# Action Plan (Sprints)

### Sprint 6 — Bug fixes (isolated, compile-safe) — ✅ COMPLETE (`54d5493`, 2026-07-06)
Self-contained bug fixes; each file opened once. All items landed, compile-verified, and committed. Detail
kept here because the commit message is terse — note the cart ticket ballooned into a full rebuild of the
mechanic part-install flow.

- ✅ **Cargo delivery reward total** — inspect panel now shows `unit_delivery_reward × quantity` (derived from the per-unit field × aggregated qty, correct across multi-stack aggregation). `convoy_cargo_menu.gd` (2026-07-01).
- ✅ **Modals double-scale fonts (receipt + tips)** — `auto_sell_receipt_modal.gd` and `returning_player_tips_modal.gd` flattened to `return base` (2026-07-01).
- ✅ **Modals double-scale fonts (popups)** — `discord_link_popup.gd` and `account_links_popup.gd` flattened to `return base` (2026-07-01).
- ✅ **Menu button mashing / stuck state** — `menu_manager.gd` now sets `_is_switching` when a switch tween starts and ignores new open/switch requests until it completes (guard at top of `_show_menu`). (2026-07-01).
- ✅ **Hide map overlay during journey planning** — during route preview, `main_screen` hides the overlay panel (`set_planning_active`) and applies a non-persisting marker override in `MapSettingsService` (`set_planning_override`) that reports all marker layers off; `UI_manager` now reads effective settings so settlements/warehouses/other convoy lines suppress, leaving the convoy + previewed route/destination. Restored on preview end/menu close. `main_screen.gd`, `map_overlay_settings_panel.gd`, `map_settings_service.gd`, `UI_manager.gd` (2026-07-06).
- ✅ **Journey ETA shows no date for long trips** — trips over 24h (departure→ETA) now force the arrival date via a new `DateTimeUtil.to_unix_utc` + `omit_date_if_today=false`. `convoy_journey_menu.gd`, `date_time_util.gd` (2026-07-06).
- ✅ **Journey delivery preview shows all cargo** — `_is_for_destination` now guards the empty-string match (an unresolved `dest_name` no longer matches every recipient-less item), so the manifest shows only this stop's deliveries. `convoy_journey_menu.gd` (2026-07-06).
- ✅ **Connected account page fills screen on mobile** — panel sized from the LOGICAL viewport (`get_visible_rect().size`) instead of physical `DisplayServer.window_get_size()`, which was ~2× the viewport on high-DPI and pushed content off-screen. `account_links_popup.gd` (2026-07-06).
- ✅ **Cart slot conflict → FULL mechanic-apply repair** — the cart ticket exposed a completely non-functional part-install flow; the whole path was rebuilt and verified live on-device (parts install, money deducts). `mechanics_menu.gd`, `mechanics_service.gd`, `api_calls.gd` (2026-07-01→07-06):
  - **Cart keying** per (vehicle, slot) — re-picking a slot replaces its pending part; vendor parts may repeat across vehicles (cart totals per vehicle), inventory parts stay single-use (`_is_candidate_in_cart_for_context`).
  - **Apply crash** — Godot's `String()` constructor threw on a non-String `cargo_id`; added `_safe_str` (→`str()`) in `apply_swaps`. (See memory: *Godot String() constructor*.)
  - **Multi-vehicle apply** — `_on_apply_pressed` gathers every carted vehicle's schedule and calls `apply_swaps` with an empty vehicle filter (was only applying the selected vehicle).
  - **Wrong part id (root cause of "nothing installs")** — the compat merge (`_update_row_from_compat_payload`) overwrote the candidate's cargo INSTANCE id with the definition's `cargo_id:null`; now re-asserts `cargo_id = cid` (the server-recognized id). `apply_swaps` also resolves `cargo_id → part_id` fallback.
  - **Routing** — inventory → `attach_vehicle_part` (owned), vendor → `add_vehicle_part` (buy+install); removed the stale `removable` gate.
  - **Non-removable inventory parts hidden** from the swap chooser (`_is_item_non_removable` in `_collect_candidate_parts_for_slot`) — the attach endpoint only accepts removable parts; non-removable ones must be bought from a vendor.
  - **Purchase cost** now uses the vendor `unit_price` (not intrinsic `value`) in `_effective_part_cost_for_entry`; install still uses `value×25% + vehicle_value×10%`.
  - **Empty turbo slot** — `_ensure_slot_row` gated on `_slot_has_swappable_candidate(vehicle, slot)` so vendor stock alone no longer forces incompatible slots (e.g. turbo→ICE) onto every vehicle.
  - **Instant money** — `api_calls._on_request_completed` merges the purchase response's `money` into the store immediately (no wait for the follow-up `/user/get`).

### Sprint 7 — Mobile / landscape polish — ✅ COMPLETE (`fe10261`/`2dc42bf`, 2026-07-10, device-verified)
All layout work, verified live on iOS. Detail kept here because the big warehouse item's real root cause
(the top bar, not the warehouse) is not obvious from the diff.

- ✅ **Login screen status messages too large on mobile** — `login_screen.gd::_apply_portrait_layout` derived the `StatusLabel` font from a **52px base × `scale_f`** (≈2.07 → ~108px), 3× the 16px button base and nearly screen-filling. Dropped to a **22px base** (proportionate — slightly larger than the buttons) and the min-height from 96→48. `login_screen.gd`.
- ✅ **Orientation change reflow** — the 5 orientation-branched menus that didn't already handle it now subscribe to `DeviceStateManager.layout_mode_changed` and rebuild in place: `convoy_vehicle_menu`, `mechanics_menu`, `settlement_overview_menu`, `convoy_menu`, `convoy_cargo_menu`. Root cause was that they read orientation only at build time. This also exposed two latent `vendor_trade_panel` crashes on rotation, both fixed: `initialize()` now `await ready` (its `@onready` trees were null when the settlement menu rebuilt tabs while detached), and `_populate_vendor_list`/`_populate_convoy_list` guard their trees before `clear_items()`.
- ✅ **Edge buffer on mobile** — `MenuBase._apply_standard_margins()` now enforces `UITheme.SPACE_LG` (16px) minimum **horizontal** padding in **both** orientations (was 14px portrait / 0 landscape). Vertical insets left exactly as before (portrait 14px, landscape 0) so it only affects side margins and never reduces sheet height.
- ✅ **Landscape nav buttons fill width** — root cause was the safe-area inset: `_update_static_nav_bar_ui` applied the screen's horizontal notch margin to the nav bar even in landscape, where the menu is a side panel nowhere near the notch — squeezing the four (already `SIZE_EXPAND_FILL`) buttons to the centre. The horizontal safe inset now applies in **portrait only**; landscape uses `bar_margin` so the buttons fill the panel. `menu_manager.gd`.
- ✅ **Landscape zoom unlock** — **no code change needed.** `route_fit_allow_zoom_past_cover` is already a global `@export` set `true`, and `smooth_fit_world_rect` honours it in both orientations (the only orientation branch, `portrait_extra_zoom_out`, only relaxes the *manual* zoom floor and defaults to off). The literal task was already satisfied; verified on device. `map_camera_controller.gd` unchanged.
- ✅ **Parts/service cards horizontal scroll in landscape** — was already implemented (outer `PartsScroll` switches to horizontal); it just never re-ran on rotation. Fixed by the reflow item above.
- ✅ **Warehouse menu mobile layout** — full portrait rebuild + landscape deadspace fix. **The real root cause of the "cramps and clips off both edges" was external to the warehouse:** the top bar (`user_info_display.gd`) at font 26 summed to a ~833px min-width, forcing `SafeRegionContainer` — and every menu under it — 33px past the 800px portrait viewport. Fixed there (fonts 26→20, edge paddings halved to 8px). Warehouse-side changes: portrait is a full-width **bottom sheet** so action rows stay on one horizontal line (not stacked); controls shrunk 120→72px; buttons 280×130→140×72; dropdowns set `fit_to_longest_item = false` + `clip_text` (they were growing to their longest cargo name once populated); long labels autowrap; quantity widget buttons 90→64px (`quantity_widget.gd`); tab bar 100→60px. Landscape: `LeftPanel`/`RightColumn` now `SIZE_EXPAND_FILL` with 1:2 stretch ratios to kill the deadspace. `warehouse_menu.gd`, `user_info_display.gd`, `quantity_widget.gd`.
  - **Debugging lesson captured in [AI_ONBOARDING.md](AI_ONBOARDING.md)** — the multi-session hunt (chased warehouse width, then height, before finding the top bar) produced a "Debugging a Visual/Layout Bug" protocol: pinpoint the element+axis first, reproduce in the editor (device builds are frozen snapshots — re-export + redeploy, and a canary needs a build stamp), measure only after slide animations settle, and rule out structure (stray back button, missing `ScrollContainer`) before tuning numbers.

### Sprint 8 — Tutorial update
Update the tutorial system to match the new UI navigation flow introduced in Sprints 5–5.5.

- [ ] **Audit existing tutorial steps** — Review `res://Data/tutorial_steps.json` for any steps that reference the old settlement flow (multi-vendor list, single settlement screen, Top Up location, vendor selector). Identify all broken node paths and copy. `tutorial_steps.json`, `Scripts/UI/tutorial_manager.gd`.
- [ ] **Update settlement hub tutorial steps** — Rewrite/add steps that walk the player through: Settlement nav → hub overview → vendor card tap → single-vendor trade → "‹ Settlement" back. Update target node paths in `target_resolver.gd` patterns as needed.
- [ ] **Update Top Up tutorial step** — Top Up moved from settlement menu to the convoy overview `TopBarHBox`. Update the step target and instructional copy.
- [ ] **Map pin tutorial** — Add or update the step that teaches pinning a settlement label and tapping the `›` chevron to open the overview. The old "tap settlement on map" behavior has changed.
- [ ] **Smoke-test full tutorial flow** — Run `wiring_smoke_test.gd` and do a manual pass through the entire tutorial on device. Verify the highlight overlay hits the correct nodes at each step.

### Sprint 9 — Map & misc polish
- [ ] **Settlement labels tap-only (mobile)** — Labels currently fire on pan gestures. Guard behind `OS.has_feature("mobile")`; show only on explicit `InputEventScreenTouch`, not `InputEventMouseMotion`. Desktop retains hover. Settlement label script / `map_interaction_manager.gd`.
- [ ] **Map overlay notch clearance** — Gear tab and expanded overlay should always clear the Dynamic Island / notch safe area on all devices, not just when `safe.position.y > 0`. When a menu panel sits under the notch, add a breathing gap between the notch floor and menu content. `map_overlay_settings_panel.gd` `_build_ui` / `_update_layout`.
- [ ] **Mechanics compatibility preloading** — Pre-fetch compatibility data for all convoy vehicles when the mechanics menu opens; show "N upgrades available" per vehicle card before the user taps in. Requires the cart to handle multi-vehicle, multi-upgrade state. `mechanics_menu.gd`, cart system.

# Backlog

Not blocking the sprints above. Pull into a sprint when the relevant file is open.

## Bugs

- **Convoy name label (P5)** — floats unanchored above the panel; integrate as a styled header. `convoy_menu.gd` TitleLabel.
- **Resource-bar text contrast (P6)** — low contrast at high fill; add outline or bump font weight. `convoy_menu.gd` ResourceStatsHBox.
- **HSeparators near-invisible (P8)** — on dark bg, replace with section labels or themed dividers.
- **`discord_popup.gd` font double-scale** — the `DiscordPopup` PopupPanel (loaded by `user_info_display.gd:445`; distinct from the already-migrated `discord_link_popup.gd`) still boosts in `_get_font_size` (`int(effective_base * boost)`). Flatten to `return base` like the other popups. Found 2026-07-06 while auditing the font migration.

## Polish / UX

- **Global spacing consistency (P9)** — `UITheme.SPACE_*` tokens exist but adoption is incomplete.
- **Settlement vendor browse (map preview)** — full read-only inventory list when viewing a settlement without a convoy. Currently shows name + "deals in" summary only. Follow-up to Sprint 5.5.
- **Convoy stats backend verification** — breakdown modal (`convoy_menu.gd`) shows computed aggregate (min for speed/offroad, average for efficiency) alongside the backend total. Backend formula not yet confirmed — verify on device.

## Tech Debt

- Duplicate Oori palette `const`s in `user_info_display.gd`, `convoy_settlement_menu.gd`, `convoy_list_panel.gd` — migrate to `UITheme.*`.
- Modals use hardcoded absolute center offsets — `auto_sell_receipt_modal`, `returning_player_tips_modal`, `premium_upgrade_modal`; replace with `CenterContainer`.
- `SettingsMenu` opened outside `MenuManager` (CanvasLayer layer=100) — lifecycle inconsistency.
- `UserInfoDisplay` height changes not signaled → stale `offset_top` on submenus.
- `main_screen.gd` wires convoy button via fragile `find_child()`.
- S/M/L UI-scale preference silently overridden in portrait.

## Migration Status (UITheme adoption)

✅ `convoy_menu`, `convoy_vehicle_menu`, `mechanics_menu`, `vendor_trade_panel`, `MenuBase`, `convoy_journey_menu` (navy chrome Sprint 3)
✅ `warehouse_menu`, `warehouse_item_card` (Oori sweep 2026-07-01)
⚠️ `convoy_settlement_menu` (partial) · `settlement_overview_menu` (new — check token use)
❌ `convoy_cargo_menu` (raw colors remain)
