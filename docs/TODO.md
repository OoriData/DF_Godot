This document will serve as a flowing state of things needed in the project, what resources are needed for each task.

> **Status:** Sprints 1–8 complete. Sprint 8 (tutorial re-fit to the settlement-**hub** UI) is committed and device-verified stable — `725c42f` ("Tutorial stable") plus the `511d2d5` flashing-panel fix — and plays end-to-end in portrait, landscape, and desktop. Two non-blocking closeout items (delete the dead vendor-tab handlers, add tutorial smoke-test coverage) were reclassified out of the sprint — see the Sprint 8 section and Tech Debt / Testing below. **Sprint 9 (map & misc polish) is the next active plan.**

# Action Plan (Sprints)

### Sprint 6 — Bug fixes (isolated, compile-safe) — ✅ COMPLETE (`54d5493`, 2026-07-06)
Self-contained bug fixes; each file opened once. All items landed, compile-verified, and committed. Detail
kept here because the commit message is terse — note the cart ticket ballooned into a full rebuild of the
mechanic part-install flow.

- ✅ **Cargo delivery reward total** — inspect panel now shows `unit_delivery_reward × quantity` (derived from the per-unit field × aggregated qty, correct across multi-stack aggregation). `convoy_cargo_menu.gd` (2026-07-01).
- ✅ **Modals double-scale fonts (receipt + tips)** — `auto_sell_receipt_modal.gd` and `returning_player_tips_modal.gd` flattened to `return base` (2026-07-01).
- ✅ **Modals double-scale fonts (popups)** — `discord_link_popup.gd` and `account_links_popup.gd` flattened to `return base` (2026-07-01).
- ✅ **Menu button mashing / stuck state** — `menu_manager.gd` now sets `_is_switching` when a switch tween starts and ignores new open/switch requests until it completes (guard at top of `_show_menu`). (2026-07-01).
- ✅ **Hide map overlay during journey planning** — during route preview, `main_screen` hides the overlay panel (`set_planning_active`) and applies a non-persisting marker override in `MapSettingsService` (`set_planning_override`) that reports all marker layers off; `UI_manager` now reads effective settings so settlements/warehouses/other convoy lines suppress, leaving the convoy + previewed route/destination. Restored on preview end/menu close. `main_screen.gd`, `map_overlay_settings_panel.gd`, `map_settings_service.gd`, `UI_manager.gd` (2026-07-06).
- ✅ **Journey ETA shows no date for long trips** — trips over 24h (departure→ETA) now force the arrival date via a new `DateTimeUtil.to_unix_utc` + `omit_date_if_today=false`. `convoy_journey_menu.gd`, `date_time_util.gd` (2026-07-06).
- ✅ **Journey delivery preview shows all cargo** — `_is_for_destination` now guards the empty-string match (an unresolved `dest_name` no longer matches every recipient-less item), so the manifest shows only this stop's deliveries. `convoy_journey_menu.gd` (2026-07-06).
- ✅ **Connected account page fills screen on mobile** — panel sized from the LOGICAL viewport (`get_visible_rect().size`) instead of physical `DisplayServer.window_get_size()`, which was ~2× the viewport on high-DPI and pushed content off-screen. `account_links_popup.gd` (2026-07-06).
- ✅ **Cart slot conflict → FULL mechanic-apply repair** — the cart ticket exposed a completely non-functional part-install flow; the whole path was rebuilt and verified live on-device (parts install, money deducts). `mechanics_menu.gd`, `mechanics_service.gd`, `api_calls.gd` (2026-07-01→07-06):
  - **Cart keying** per (vehicle, slot) — re-picking a slot replaces its pending part; vendor parts may repeat across vehicles (cart totals per vehicle), inventory parts stay single-use (`_is_candidate_in_cart_for_context`).
  - **Apply crash** — Godot's `String()` constructor threw on a non-String `cargo_id`; added `_safe_str` (→`str()`) in `apply_swaps`. (See memory: *Godot String() constructor*.)
  - **Multi-vehicle apply** — `_on_apply_pressed` gathers every carted vehicle's schedule and calls `apply_swaps` with an empty vehicle filter (was only applying the selected vehicle).
  - **Wrong part id (root cause of "nothing installs")** — the compat merge (`_update_row_from_compat_payload`) overwrote the candidate's cargo INSTANCE id with the definition's `cargo_id:null`; now re-asserts `cargo_id = cid` (the server-recognized id). `apply_swaps` also resolves `cargo_id → part_id` fallback.
  - **Routing** — inventory → `attach_vehicle_part` (owned), vendor → `add_vehicle_part` (buy+install); removed the stale `removable` gate.
  - **Non-removable inventory parts hidden** from the swap chooser (`_is_item_non_removable` in `_collect_candidate_parts_for_slot`) — the attach endpoint only accepts removable parts; non-removable ones must be bought from a vendor.
  - **Purchase cost** now uses the vendor `unit_price` (not intrinsic `value`) in `_effective_part_cost_for_entry`; install still uses `value×25% + vehicle_value×10%`.
  - **Empty turbo slot** — `_ensure_slot_row` gated on `_slot_has_swappable_candidate(vehicle, slot)` so vendor stock alone no longer forces incompatible slots (e.g. turbo→ICE) onto every vehicle.
  - **Instant money** — `api_calls._on_request_completed` merges the purchase response's `money` into the store immediately (no wait for the follow-up `/user/get`).

### Sprint 7 — Mobile / landscape polish — ✅ COMPLETE (`fe10261`/`2dc42bf`, 2026-07-10, device-verified)
All layout work, verified live on iOS. Detail kept here because the big warehouse item's real root cause
(the top bar, not the warehouse) is not obvious from the diff.

- ✅ **Login screen status messages too large on mobile** — `login_screen.gd::_apply_portrait_layout` derived the `StatusLabel` font from a **52px base × `scale_f`** (≈2.07 → ~108px), 3× the 16px button base and nearly screen-filling. Dropped to a **22px base** (proportionate — slightly larger than the buttons) and the min-height from 96→48. `login_screen.gd`.
- ✅ **Orientation change reflow** — the 5 orientation-branched menus that didn't already handle it now subscribe to `DeviceStateManager.layout_mode_changed` and rebuild in place: `convoy_vehicle_menu`, `mechanics_menu`, `settlement_overview_menu`, `convoy_menu`, `convoy_cargo_menu`. Root cause was that they read orientation only at build time. This also exposed two latent `vendor_trade_panel` crashes on rotation, both fixed: `initialize()` now `await ready` (its `@onready` trees were null when the settlement menu rebuilt tabs while detached), and `_populate_vendor_list`/`_populate_convoy_list` guard their trees before `clear_items()`.
- ✅ **Edge buffer on mobile** — `MenuBase._apply_standard_margins()` now enforces `UITheme.SPACE_LG` (16px) minimum **horizontal** padding in **both** orientations (was 14px portrait / 0 landscape). Vertical insets left exactly as before (portrait 14px, landscape 0) so it only affects side margins and never reduces sheet height.
- ✅ **Landscape nav buttons fill width** — root cause was the safe-area inset: `_update_static_nav_bar_ui` applied the screen's horizontal notch margin to the nav bar even in landscape, where the menu is a side panel nowhere near the notch — squeezing the four (already `SIZE_EXPAND_FILL`) buttons to the centre. The horizontal safe inset now applies in **portrait only**; landscape uses `bar_margin` so the buttons fill the panel. `menu_manager.gd`.
- ✅ **Landscape zoom unlock** — **no code change needed.** `route_fit_allow_zoom_past_cover` is already a global `@export` set `true`, and `smooth_fit_world_rect` honours it in both orientations (the only orientation branch, `portrait_extra_zoom_out`, only relaxes the *manual* zoom floor and defaults to off). The literal task was already satisfied; verified on device. `map_camera_controller.gd` unchanged.
- ✅ **Parts/service cards horizontal scroll in landscape** — was already implemented (outer `PartsScroll` switches to horizontal); it just never re-ran on rotation. Fixed by the reflow item above.
- ✅ **Warehouse menu mobile layout** — full portrait rebuild + landscape deadspace fix. **The real root cause of the "cramps and clips off both edges" was external to the warehouse:** the top bar (`user_info_display.gd`) at font 26 summed to a ~833px min-width, forcing `SafeRegionContainer` — and every menu under it — 33px past the 800px portrait viewport. Fixed there (fonts 26→20, edge paddings halved to 8px). Warehouse-side changes: portrait is a full-width **bottom sheet** so action rows stay on one horizontal line (not stacked); controls shrunk 120→72px; buttons 280×130→140×72; dropdowns set `fit_to_longest_item = false` + `clip_text` (they were growing to their longest cargo name once populated); long labels autowrap; quantity widget buttons 90→64px (`quantity_widget.gd`); tab bar 100→60px. Landscape: `LeftPanel`/`RightColumn` now `SIZE_EXPAND_FILL` with 1:2 stretch ratios to kill the deadspace. `warehouse_menu.gd`, `user_info_display.gd`, `quantity_widget.gd`.
  - **Debugging lesson captured in [AI_ONBOARDING.md](AI_ONBOARDING.md)** — the multi-session hunt (chased warehouse width, then height, before finding the top bar) produced a "Debugging a Visual/Layout Bug" protocol: pinpoint the element+axis first, reproduce in the editor (device builds are frozen snapshots — re-export + redeploy, and a canary needs a build stamp), measure only after slide animations settle, and rule out structure (stray back button, missing `ScrollContainer`) before tuning numbers.

### Sprint 8 — Tutorial update — ✅ COMPLETE (`725c42f`/`511d2d5`, 2026-07-16, device-verified stable)
Re-fit the tutorial's per-step highlights and inter-step flow to the Sprint 5–5.5 settlement-**hub** UI.
**Preserve the checkpoint skeleton** — the server `metadata.tutorial` stages (L1 buy vehicle → L2
supplies+topup → L4 delivery → L5 journey → L6/L7 messages) do **not** change; only the *intra-level*
steps (highlights + the flow between them) get re-fit.

**Where the steps actually live:** hardcoded in `tutorial_manager.gd::_build_level_steps()` — **NOT** a
JSON file. The docs' `res://Data/tutorial_steps.json` doesn't exist and the JSON loader is disabled at
`tutorial_manager.gd:1851` (it drifted out of sync and ran wrong steps). **Decision:** keep steps in
GDScript for this sprint and correct the docs to match; a JSON migration is a separate, later task
(it would only externalize `copy`/`target` — each `action` still needs bespoke watcher code).

**Desktop ⇄ mobile parity is a first-class requirement.** The hub reflows hard between portrait (2-col
card grid, stacked resources/warehouse) and landscape/desktop (N-col grid, side-by-side) —
`settlement_overview_menu.gd:210/509`. Every new highlight must resolve by **content identity** (vendor
name label, button text), never a fixed rect/index, and re-resolve on `layout_mode_changed` rebuilds.
**Verify every fixed step in portrait, landscape, AND desktop.**

Tutorial-city vendor card labels (match by substring): `Tutorial City Dealership`,
`Tutorial City Market`, `Tutorial City Gas Station`.

**Status (final, 2026-07-16):** ✅ All levels (L1, L2, L4, L5) reworked/verified and playing end-to-end on
device in portrait, landscape, and desktop. Ten rounds of device-feedback polish landed (rounds 1–9 below
+ round 10 flashing-panel fix). Compile-clean (standard + warnings-as-errors). **Reclassified out of the
sprint (non-blocking):** deleting the dead `await_dealership_tab`/`await_market_tab` handlers → Tech Debt
(scope corrected — see that item); tutorial-flow smoke-test coverage → Testing backlog. The doc fix landed.

- [x] **L1 — settlement entry + vendor card (softlock fix)** — `await_settlement_hub` (waits for
  `menu_opened("settlement_hub")`) + `await_vendor_open` (waits for `menu_opened("convoy_settlement_submenu")`),
  new `settlement_hub_vendor_card` resolver matching the card by `vendor_name` meta (hub tags cards +
  `get_vendor_card_node_by_name_contains()`). Device-verified through buy. `tutorial_manager.gd`,
  `target_resolver.gd`, `settlement_overview_menu.gd`.
- [x] **Retarget Top Up** — resolver + `_watch_for_top_up` now prefer the hub's resources-card Top Up button
  (tagged `is_top_up_button`, exposed via `get_top_up_button_node()`); legacy settlement-menu path kept as
  fallback. Already-full guard handles the hub's "Topped Up" label.
- [x] **L2 — hub flow, both supply beats kept** — back to hub → tap Market card → buy 2 MRE + 2 Water → back
  to hub → Top Up. Compile-clean; **pending device test.**
- [x] **L4 — first delivery, hub flow** — reworked: (user is in the hub after the L2 top-up) tap Market card →
  buy Mountain Urchins → **straight to the Journey menu** (round 3: dropped the L4 top-up / return-to-settlement
  steps; resources were filled in L2 and `l5_open_journey_menu` forces stage 6 → warp). **Pending device test**
  (esp. the warp actually firing without an L4 top-up).
- [x] **L5 — journey (verify only)** — verified on device; the warp race (convoy at 0,0 → `l5_pick_destination`
  suspends) resolves cleanly and the route confirms. Camera-focus stale-snapshot fix (round 9) also covers this.
- [→] **Remove now-dead tab machinery** — **moved to Tech Debt, scope corrected.** Audit finding: only
  `await_dealership_tab`/`await_market_tab` (match arms `tutorial_manager.gd:793`/`821`) + `_hint_dealership_tab`
  are truly dead — no step in `_build_level_steps()` emits those actions. **`_lock_vendor_tabs`/
  `_watch_for_tab_selected`/`_on_vendor_tab_selected` are still live** — the `lock_tabs_for_actions` list
  (`tutorial_manager.gd:693`) wires them to the live `await_vehicle_purchase`/`await_supply_purchase`/
  `await_urchin_purchase` steps. Deleting the whole set as the earlier note claimed would break tab-locking
  during purchases. (First verify the hub's single-vendor menu even has a `TabContainer` — if not, the lock is
  already a no-op and the whole block can go.)
- [→] **Smoke-test full flow** — **moved to Testing backlog.** `Scripts/Debug/wiring_smoke_test.gd` still only
  asserts autoload wiring (zero tutorial references); tutorial-flow coverage never landed. The manual
  portrait/landscape/desktop pass was done instead (device-verified stable). Automated coverage is a follow-up.
- [x] **Docs** — corrected the "steps are JSON" claim in `TutorialSystemOverview.md` (with a follow-up doc-sync
  pass 2026-07-16 fixing the residual JSON framing in the mermaid diagram, `StepSchema.md`, and `Controllers.md`).

**Device-feedback polish (round 1) — 2026-07-10:**
- [x] **Highlight fired before the card settled** — `settlement_hub_vendor_card` resolver waits until the card's
  rect is stable across two frames before measuring (`target_resolver.gd`), so it no longer flashes at the
  card's pre-slide position.
- [x] **First-convoy modal fit + keyboard** — `NewConvoyDialog` was a fixed 1000×480 panel; now sizes to the
  viewport, wraps the title, compacts fonts/heights in landscape, and is top-anchored. (Refined in round 2.)
- [~] **Tutorial text overlapped the menu** — first attempt capped the panel + scrolled; reverted in round 2
  (see below) because scrolling was unwanted.

**Device-feedback polish (round 2, from L1/L2 pass) — 2026-07-10, pending re-verify:**
- [x] **Modal hidden behind the top bar** — round-1 top-anchor tucked the card under the top bar.
  `_update_new_convoy_dialog_layout` now offsets it below the top bar's bottom edge (measured relative to the
  dialog's parent), so the title is fully visible while staying clear of the keyboard.
- [x] **No more scrolling in the tutorial text box** — reverted the ScrollContainer/height-cap in
  `tutorial_overlay.gd`; the panel sizes to content (no scroll), stays width-bounded and below the top bar, and
  the landscape side-menu right-inset is kept. Per-step copy must stay short enough to fit the map strip — long
  copy is split across steps or trimmed (e.g. the L1 buy-vehicle copy was shortened).
- [x] **Back-to-hub uses the vendor menu's top-left button** — the L2 "return to settlement" steps use the
  `convoy_return_button` resolver → `back_requested` → `go_back()` reopens the hub and re-emits
  `menu_opened("settlement_hub")`, instead of pressing the Settlement nav twice. (Resolver target corrected in
  round 3 — see below.)

**Device-feedback polish (round 3, from L1–L4 pass) — 2026-07-10, pending re-verify:**
- [x] **Back button wasn't highlighting** — the real top-left back control is a `PanelContainer` named
  `BackToSettlementButton` ("‹ <settlement> / <vendor>") mounted *inside the vendor panel's control row*, not
  `MainVBox/TopBarHBox/TitleLabel`. `_resolve_convoy_return_button` now finds `BackToSettlementButton` first
  (`target_resolver.gd`). It doesn't read as a button, so highlighting it is what makes the back path findable.
- [x] **Top Up highlight blended in** — the hub Top Up button was brass (gold), the same as the gold highlight.
  Recolored to `UITheme.STATUS_GOOD` (green) in `settlement_overview_menu.gd::_make_top_up_button`.
- [x] **After urchins: go to Journey, not Settlement** — L4 now ends at the urchin purchase and L5 sends the
  player straight to the Journey menu (see L4 item above). ✅ *The "vendor menu blanks after purchase" bug is now
  root-caused and fixed — see round 5 below (it was a vendor-tree crash, not a `convoy_settlement_menu` issue).*
- [x] **Confirm Journey wasn't clickable** — the highlight hole excluded the dynamically-built Confirm button,
  and the shield blocked the tap. `l5_embark` is now ungated (`lock = "none"`, no target); the whole screen is
  interactive and the watcher still advances on journey start. Added an empty-target guard in
  `_resolve_and_highlight` so ungated steps don't spin the resolver retry loop.

**Device-feedback polish (round 4, from L1–L2 landscape pass) — 2026-07-10, pending re-verify:**
- [x] **Text box overlapped the vendor menu (landscape)** — two root causes: (1) the inset heuristic missed a
  side menu whose left edge sat below the 40% threshold; (2) the message `RichTextLabel` has `fit_content = true`,
  so it sized to the **unwrapped** text width and forced the panel wider than any width cap (a `custom_minimum_size.x`
  floor can't cap it). `tutorial_overlay.gd::_relayout_panel` now: clamps the panel's right edge directly against
  the live `MenuContainer` rect (no threshold, 16px gap); **bounds the label's `custom_minimum_size.x`** so it
  wraps to the panel width instead of spilling; drops the VBox's 380px min width; and uses a smaller landscape
  left margin (`_safe_left_inset + 16`) so the panel uses the empty strip left of the map. No scroll; copy stays short.
- [x] **Supply step "not updating" — kept the strict Water-Jerry-Cans match** — the vendor stocks BOTH plain
  `Jerry Cans` (fuel) and `Water Jerry Cans` (water); the water total must require **both** `water` AND `jerry`
  (never bare `jerry`) so a plain-jerry-can purchase doesn't wrongly satisfy the step. See
  [[reference_jerry_cans_vs_water]] and the TutorialSystem "Content gotcha" note. Added `[Tutorial][DIAG] supply
  cargo item=…` logging in `_on_supply_check` so a wrong-item purchase is obvious in the logs. *If a genuine
  `Water Jerry Cans` buy still doesn't count, those logs will show whether `_on_supply_check` fires and what
  cargo it sees — root-cause from there.*

**Device-feedback polish (round 5) — 2026-07-10, pending re-verify:**
- [x] **Vendor menu crashed/blanked after a purchase** — root cause: `VendorTreeBuilder.make_display_agg_with_parts_rebucket`
  pre-seeded a `"missions"` bucket, but the aggregator (`cargo_aggregator.gd`) emits delivery cargo under `"delivery"`
  (stale rename). Copying agg's `"delivery"` bucket into a display_agg that lacked it threw *"Invalid access to key
  'delivery'"* (`tree_builder.gd:52`) during the post-purchase tree rebuild → blank menu. Fix: pre-seed `"delivery"`
  + defensively create any missing bucket during the copy (`tree_builder.gd`); and the caller's category map now keys
  on `"delivery"` (`vendor_trade_panel.gd::_populate_list_from_agg`) so **Delivery Cargo (e.g. Mountain Urchins) also
  renders** instead of silently vanishing. `"missions"` kept as a legacy title alias.
- [x] **Crash re-entering the Market vendor** — `vendor_item_list.gd::_ensure_row_visible` did `await
  get_tree().process_frame`, but on re-entry `populate` re-selects the previous row while the list is still
  **detached from the tree**, so `get_tree()` was null → *"Invalid access to 'process_frame' on a null instance"*.
  Now guards `get_tree()` and skips the scroll-into-view (a nicety) when detached. (No other unguarded
  `await get_tree()` in the vendor/settlement rebuild paths.)
- [x] **Text box still grazed the menu (landscape)** — see round-4 update: the `fit_content` label was the real
  culprit; now width-bounded so it wraps within the clamped panel.

**Device-feedback polish (round 6) — 2026-07-10, pending re-verify:**
- [x] **Confirm Journey still un-tappable (round-3 fix incomplete)** — `lock = "none"` hid the shield ring, but
  the overlay **Control itself** kept `mouse_filter = STOP`: `tutorial_overlay.gd::clear_highlight` set STOP for
  any non-SOFT gating, so the ungated full-screen overlay silently ate the tap. Now only **HARD** blocks; NONE
  (ungated) and SOFT (hole) pass input through. Message steps are unaffected (they don't call `clear_highlight`).
- [x] **Vendor disappears after buying Mountain Urchins** — a `map_changed` right after a mission-item purchase
  ran `_display_settlement_info`, which `_clear_tabs()` then rebuilt nothing when the fresh snapshot momentarily
  lacked the vendor → blank. Added a single-vendor guard (`convoy_settlement_menu.gd`): if a tab is already shown
  and the incoming snapshot doesn't contain `_single_vendor_id`, skip the destructive rebuild and keep the tab.
  *Hypothesis-based (couldn't repro locally); the existing `[DIAGNOSTIC] _display_settlement_info called` +
  new skip log will confirm the trigger on device.*

**Device-feedback polish (round 7) — 2026-07-10, pending re-verify:**
- [x] **Convoy journey route line not showing on selection** — the route LINE and the delivery-destination
  ARCS were both gated by the same `active_delivery_destinations` ("Delivery Targets") toggle, which defaults
  off. Per design intent, decoupled them: the focused/selected convoy's **journey line always draws** now
  (`UI_manager.gd::_on_connector_lines_container_draw` — removed the `show_active_lines` gate on the focused
  convoy; `all_convoy_destinations` still shows every convoy's line). The **"Delivery Targets" toggle now only
  gates the curved destination arcs/markers**, which is what it should do. Not a regression from the tutorial
  work — no map code had been touched; the toggle was simply off (likely reset with the test account).

**Device-feedback polish (round 8, restart softlock) — 2026-07-14, pending device test:**
- [x] **Softlock when resuming a level from the map root** — the tutorial always resumes at `_step = 0`
  (`tutorial_manager.gd::_maybe_start` forces it), but several levels' first step assumed the player was
  already deep in a menu. On a fresh restart the game reopens at the map root with **no menu**, so the
  shared bottom nav bar (Vehicles / Journey / Settlement / Cargo) doesn't exist — L5's `l5_open_journey_menu`
  highlighted a "Journey" button that wasn't there, and L2's `l2_return_to_hub` a vendor back button that
  wasn't there. The instruction pointed at nothing → softlock (reported at the Journey screen). Fix: a
  **resume anchor** (`await_convoy_menu` action) prepended to L2 and L5. It auto-advances with no prompt when
  a convoy submenu is already active (continuous path — zero disruption), and on a restart highlights the
  always-present **convoy dropdown** and waits for any convoy menu to open (which brings the nav bar up).
  `CONVOY_SUBMENU_TYPES` + `_is_convoy_submenu_active()` gate the fail-safe (kept in sync with
  `menu_manager.gd::_update_static_nav_bar_ui`). Also made `target_resolver.gd::_resolve_convoy_return_button`
  adaptive: when there's no vendor back button but a convoy submenu is open, it highlights the **Settlement
  nav button** (not the convoy dropdown), so L2's return-to-hub step guides Convoy dropdown → Settlement → hub
  on the restart path. Compile-clean (standard + warnings-as-errors).

**Device-feedback polish (round 9, camera focuses old convoy spot) — 2026-07-14, pending device test:**
- [x] **Camera pans to the pre-warp location on tutorial exit** — when the tutorial's final menu closes, the
  camera focuses on the convoy using `_last_focused_convoy_data`, a snapshot captured at **menu-open**. During
  L5 the backend warps the convoy from (0,0) to its start city, so that snapshot's top-level `x`/`y` are stale
  and the close tween (`main_screen.gd::_slide_menu_close` → `smooth_focus_on_convoy_with_final_occlusion`)
  panned to the old tile. Root cause is general: the menu's `menu_data` meta and `_last_focused_convoy_data`
  are never refreshed after open, and `map_camera_controller.get_convoy_world_position()` reads `x`/`y` from
  the passed dict. Fix: new `main_screen.gd::_refresh_convoy_data_from_store()` re-resolves the convoy by
  `convoy_id` from GameStore (live coords) right before every camera-focus call — menu open, menu close, the
  layout-reposition path, and `_get_primary_convoy_data` (return-to-convoy). Safe because both the snapshot
  and the store dict lack the runtime interpolation fields, so only the coordinates change. Compile-clean
  (standard + warnings-as-errors).

**Device-feedback polish (round 10, flashing panel) — 2026-07-16 (`511d2d5`), device-verified:**
- [x] **Tutorial text box flashed to near-full-screen for one frame** — two independent root causes in
  `tutorial_overlay.gd`, both timing-related and only visible during polled updates (checklist rebuilds on every
  `convoys_changed`): (1) `_update_checklist` recreated **autowrapping** `Label`s each update; a fresh autowrap
  label shapes its text at width 0 for one frame → reports a wrapped-at-zero-width min HEIGHT of hundreds of px,
  which the panel adopts as its minimum and flashes tall. Fixed by making checklist rows **single-line +
  ellipsis** (`AUTOWRAP_OFF` + `OVERRUN_TRIM_ELLIPSIS`, zero min-width, FILL) so row height is deterministic and
  width still can't inflate the panel. (2) In portrait, `_relayout_panel` clamped the panel's right edge to the
  menu's left edge, but portrait menus are full-width **bottom sheets** that slide in **horizontally** (left edge
  sweeps 800→0) — tracking that sweep shrank the box 600→120 frame-by-frame then snapped back. Fixed by skipping
  the menu-edge clamp entirely in portrait (only landscape has a real right-anchored side menu to dodge). Panel
  height (`size.y`) was also added to the layout-change diagnostic trigger (top-anchored growth is invisible to
  the width/position checks).

> **Dropped from scope:** the map-pin teaching step. The tutorial keeps its current entry flow (convoy
> dropdown → Settlement nav); it does not teach map-label pinning.

### Sprint 9 — Map & misc polish — 🎯 ACTIVE (focus: map/route polish quick wins first)

**Batch A — map/route polish.** A1, A3, A4 code-complete + compile-clean (2026-07-16), **pending device test**;
A2 deferred (not reproduced). Next up: batch the three device tests, then move to Batch B. Verify each fix in
portrait, landscape, AND desktop where relevant.

- [x] **A1 · Settlement labels tap-only (mobile)** — *code complete 2026-07-16, compile-clean (standard +
  warnings-as-errors); pending device test.* Root cause was **not** `InputEventMouseMotion` (the `_process` hover
  path is already gated to `ControlScheme.MOUSE_AND_KEYBOARD`, which `_ready()` never selects on iOS/Android). It
  was the three `_update_hover()` calls inside `_handle_touch_input` — on touch **drag** (the pan gesture) plus
  press/release — that flashed labels under the finger while panning. Added `_touch_hover_enabled()` (returns
  `active_control_scheme != ControlScheme.TOUCH`) and gated all three call sites. On mobile, labels now reveal
  **only** via an explicit tap (`_handle_tap_interaction` → `settlement_clicked` → pin); a desktop touchscreen
  keeps `MOUSE_AND_KEYBOARD` scheme, so its hover is unchanged. `map_interaction_manager.gd`.
- [~] **A2 · Map overlay notch clearance** — **deferred, not reproduced (2026-07-16).** Code audit found the panel
  already applies safe-area insets on *both* axes, ungated: expanded content clears a top notch via
  `content_margin_top = pad_tb + safe.position.y` (with `pad_tb` breathing room) and a left notch via
  `content_margin_left = pad_lr + safe.position.x`; the collapsed gear tab is shifted right by `safe_left`
  (`_update_layout:412`); and the gear tab is vertically centered, so it clears a top notch by construction. The
  TODO's "only when `safe.position.y > 0`" premise doesn't match the current code — there's no such gate. User has
  not observed the symptom, so no change made. Revisit only with a concrete device repro (element + orientation).
  `map_overlay_settings_panel.gd`.
- [x] **A3 · Vendor cards clip below nav (mobile-landscape hub)** — *code complete 2026-07-16, compile-clean
  (standard + warnings-as-errors); pending device test.* **Re-scoped:** the cards live in the **hub**
  (`settlement_overview_menu.gd`), not `convoy_settlement_menu.gd`, and the hub is **no-scroll by design**
  (line 144, "I never want to scroll"). Per user decision, fixed by **fit-to-height, not scrolling**: in
  mobile-landscape only, the vendor grid now packs up to 4 vendors into **one row** (`grid.columns =
  clampi(vendors.size(), 2, 4)`, was `ceil(N/2)` → 2 rows for 3–4 vendors) with a shorter `card_h` (120→96),
  and the resources/warehouse row min trimmed (176→150). Portrait and **desktop are untouched** (scoped via
  `(not portrait) and _is_mobile()`). `settlement_overview_menu.gd`.
- [x] **A4 · Map labels occlude journey route line** — *code complete 2026-07-16, compile-clean (standard +
  warnings-as-errors); pending device test.* Turned out to be a clean **extension of the existing anti-collision
  loop** in `_position_settlement_panel` (which already nudged settlement labels off other labels + convoy icons),
  not a rewrite. Added `_settlement_panel_overlaps_route(panel_rect)` (mirrors `_settlement_panel_overlaps_convoy`;
  converts `_preview_route_x/y` tile coords to the same `(tile+0.5)*tile_size` local space) + an exact segment-vs-AABB
  helper `_segment_hits_rect` (Geometry2D edge tests), and wired `overlaps_route` into the loop's break condition. A
  new `@export settlement_route_keepout_px = 14.0` sets the clearance (inspector-tunable). No-op unless a preview is
  active. **Known limitation:** the nudge is vertical-only (existing behavior), so a route running *vertically*
  through a label may not fully clear — good enough for the common horizontal-ish case ("nudge where possible");
  revisit with horizontal nudging if device testing shows it's needed. **Scope note:** covers **settlement** labels;
  convoy labels are managed separately (`convoy_label_manager`) and during preview the convoy sits at the start, so
  settlement labels along the route are the main occluders. `UI_manager.gd`.
  - **Follow-up (user ask): zoom out so labels fit the view.** The route-fit already padded for labels
    (`route_fit_label_padding_px`, symmetric), but settlement labels anchor *above* their tile and A4's nudge can
    push the topmost ones higher, so the top edge was under-padded. Added `@export route_fit_label_top_extra_px =
    60.0` (screen px, inspector-tunable) applied **only to the top** of the fit bounds in `smooth_fit_route_preview`
    (`grow_individual(lpad.x, lpad.y + top_extra, lpad.x, lpad.y)`), so the camera zooms out a touch more and the
    top labels stay on-screen. `map_camera_controller.gd`.
  - **Follow-up 2 (device feedback: "only the label's center fits").** Root cause: for anything but a tiny route,
    `smooth_fit_world_rect` blends the camera toward the focus point (`dest_world`), which was the destination
    **tile** — the bare point *below* the label — so the fit centered under the label and only its lower half
    showed. Bounds padding helped short routes but the blend canceled it on longer ones. Fix: lift the focus point
    up by the top headroom (`dest_world.y -= route_fit_label_top_extra_px / est_zoom`) so the fit targets where the
    **label** sits, keeping the whole label in view. Single knob (`route_fit_label_top_extra_px`) now drives both the
    bounds pad and the focus lift. `map_camera_controller.gd::smooth_fit_route_preview`.

**Batch B:**
- [x] **Vehicle stats missing in vendor menu** — *code complete 2026-07-16, compile-clean (standard +
  warnings-as-errors); pending device test.* **Root cause:** the vehicle stat pairs in
  `vendor_item_list.gd::_stat_pairs` looked up `top_speed`/`offroad_capability`/`weight_capacity`/`cargo_capacity`/
  `fuel_efficiency`, but **vendor** vehicle payloads carry those under `base_*` keys (the plain keys are null), so
  `_push_num` found nothing and the row fell back to just Value + Available. The inspector already had the `base_*`
  fallbacks; the list rows never did. Fix: added `base_*` fallback keys to each vehicle `_push_num` call (fixes both
  the landscape chip grid via `build_stat_chips` and the compact bbcode line via `stat_line_bbcode`, which share
  `_stat_pairs`). `vendor_item_list.gd`.
- [x] **Vehicle inspector = summary-page info + description popup button** *(user follow-up; code complete
  2026-07-16, compile-clean; pending device test).* Made the vendor vehicle **inspector** show the same info as the
  convoy vehicle **summary page**, plus a description popup button. `inspector_builder.gd`: added **Seats**
  (`passenger_seats`/`base_passenger_seats`) to the vehicle stat block; added conditional **Make/Model / Color /
  Shape** rows (shown only when present — the summary skips empties the same way); and a **Description** row that
  `_make_panel` renders as a "View ›" button opening `_show_description_popup` (a self-contained `AcceptDialog`,
  autowrap, freed on close, titled with the vehicle name). **Data note:** for current vendor stock, `passenger_seats`
  / `make_model` / `color` / `shape` come through **null** — only `name`, the `base_*` stats, `base_value`, and
  `base_desc` (description) are populated — so in practice the new visible additions are **Seats (when present) + the
  Description button**; the rest light up automatically if/when the backend populates them. Popup is functional/plain
  (Godot `AcceptDialog`); a themed popup is a possible follow-up. `inspector_builder.gd`.
  - **Follow-up (device: "no change in mobile-landscape").** Root cause: for a vehicle in landscape,
    `vendor_trade_panel.gd::_update_landscape_summary` **hides `InfoSectionsContainer`** (where the Description button
    + Seats/Make-Model rows live) and the description panel, showing only compact stat chips — so the button never
    appeared there (the stat chips *did* pick up the fixed vehicle stats). Per user choice, surfaced a compact
    **"Description ›"** popup button in the landscape stat summary for vehicles with a description. Made
    `vehicle_description()` / `show_description_popup()` public on `VendorInspectorBuilder` and reused them.
    `vendor_trade_panel.gd`, `inspector_builder.gd`.
  - **Follow-up 2 (device: no description in portrait).** Portrait uses an inline-expand **row body** as its
    inspector (`_build_row_body`) and hides the whole MiddlePanel — so the Description button was never present in
    portrait. Added a **"Description ›"** popup button (mouse_filter STOP, like the inline Install button) to the
    vehicle row body, reusing `VendorInspectorBuilder.show_description_popup`. `vendor_item_list.gd`.
  - **Follow-up 3 (device: "Efficiency 0 on every vehicle is wrong").** **Data-field bug + a bad first fix.**
    Vendor vehicle payloads store efficiency in a legacy `base_fuel_efficiency` that is **`0` for every vehicle**
    (verified across all 8 in `vendor_example.json`); the *real* efficiency lives in `efficiency`/`base_efficiency`
    (as on owned vehicles — e.g. `efficiency: 21`, `base_efficiency: 35` in `convoy_data_example.json`), which the
    vendor payload does **not** include. My previous `allow_zero` change forced that meaningless 0 to render on
    every vehicle. Reverted `allow_zero` entirely, and reordered the efficiency lookup to
    `["efficiency", "base_efficiency", "fuel_efficiency", "base_fuel_efficiency"]` (chips) with a null-out-if-0
    guard in the inspector — so efficiency shows the **real** value when the backend provides it and is **omitted**
    (no misleading "0") when only the empty legacy field exists. **Backend note:** to actually display efficiency
    for vendor stock, the API must populate `base_efficiency`/`efficiency` on vendor vehicles — it currently sends
    only `base_fuel_efficiency: 0`. `vendor_item_list.gd`, `inspector_builder.gd`.
- [ ] **Mechanics compatibility preloading** — Pre-fetch compatibility data for all convoy vehicles when the mechanics menu opens; show "N upgrades available" per vehicle card before the user taps in. Requires the cart to handle multi-vehicle, multi-upgrade state. `mechanics_menu.gd`, cart system.

# Backlog

Not blocking the sprints above. Pull into a sprint when the relevant file is open.

## Bugs

- **Convoy name label (P5)** — floats unanchored above the panel; integrate as a styled header. `convoy_menu.gd` TitleLabel.
- **Resource-bar text contrast (P6)** — low contrast at high fill; add outline or bump font weight. `convoy_menu.gd` ResourceStatsHBox.
- **HSeparators near-invisible (P8)** — on dark bg, replace with section labels or themed dividers.
- **`discord_popup.gd` font double-scale** — the `DiscordPopup` PopupPanel (loaded by `user_info_display.gd:445`; distinct from the already-migrated `discord_link_popup.gd`) still boosts in `_get_font_size` (`int(effective_base * boost)`). Flatten to `return base` like the other popups. Found 2026-07-06 while auditing the font migration.

## Polish / UX

- **Global spacing consistency (P9)** — `UITheme.SPACE_*` tokens exist but adoption is incomplete.
- **Settlement vendor browse (map preview)** — full read-only inventory list when viewing a settlement without a convoy. Currently shows name + "deals in" summary only. Follow-up to Sprint 5.5.
- **Convoy stats backend verification** — breakdown modal (`convoy_menu.gd`) shows computed aggregate (min for speed/offroad, average for efficiency) alongside the backend total. Backend formula not yet confirmed — verify on device.

## Tech Debt

- Duplicate Oori palette `const`s in `user_info_display.gd`, `convoy_settlement_menu.gd`, `convoy_list_panel.gd` — migrate to `UITheme.*`.
- Modals use hardcoded absolute center offsets — `auto_sell_receipt_modal`, `returning_player_tips_modal`, `premium_upgrade_modal`; replace with `CenterContainer`.
- `SettingsMenu` opened outside `MenuManager` (CanvasLayer layer=100) — lifecycle inconsistency.
- `UserInfoDisplay` height changes not signaled → stale `offset_top` on submenus.
- `main_screen.gd` wires convoy button via fragile `find_child()`.
- S/M/L UI-scale preference silently overridden in portrait.
- **Dead tutorial tab handlers** — `await_dealership_tab`/`await_market_tab` match arms (`tutorial_manager.gd:793`/`821`) + `_hint_dealership_tab` are no longer emitted by any step after the Sprint 8 hub rework. Safe to delete. **Do not** delete `_lock_vendor_tabs`/`_watch_for_tab_selected`/`_on_vendor_tab_selected` — the `lock_tabs_for_actions` list (`tutorial_manager.gd:693`) still wires them to the live `await_vehicle_purchase`/`await_supply_purchase`/`await_urchin_purchase` steps. First confirm the hub's single-vendor menu still has a `TabContainer` (`_get_vendor_tab_container()`); if it doesn't, the lock is already a no-op and the whole block can go.

## Testing

- **Tutorial-flow smoke coverage** — `Scripts/Debug/wiring_smoke_test.gd` only asserts autoload wiring today. Extend it toward tutorial-flow coverage (step build, resolver resolution per level) so a hub/menu rename can't silently break onboarding. Sprint 8 shipped on a manual portrait/landscape/desktop pass instead.

## Migration Status (UITheme adoption)

✅ `convoy_menu`, `convoy_vehicle_menu`, `mechanics_menu`, `vendor_trade_panel`, `MenuBase`, `convoy_journey_menu` (navy chrome Sprint 3)
✅ `warehouse_menu`, `warehouse_item_card` (Oori sweep 2026-07-01)
⚠️ `convoy_settlement_menu` (partial) · `settlement_overview_menu` (new — check token use)
❌ `convoy_cargo_menu` (raw colors remain)
